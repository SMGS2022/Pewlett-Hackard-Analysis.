# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview

Bobby's boss wants to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees eligible for the mentorship program. 

## Results

##### In using the initial constructed ERD as a reference, I was able to create a Retirement Titltes table holding all the most recent titles of employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.

### Retiring Employees by Title (not full list)

#### The Unique Titles Table Indicates:

- Employees born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955
- Employee numbers, first/last names, and most recent title
- Exclusion of employees no longer working for the company

#### The Mentorship Eligibilty Table Indicates:

## Summary

- 90,398 roles will need to be filled. 
- Hopefully of all the employees eligible for the mentorship program participate, however; there are still a significant amount of employees in need of a mentor. 
- Focus has been on management positions over the years and not technocal position renewal.
